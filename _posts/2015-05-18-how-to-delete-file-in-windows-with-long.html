<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Windows has a restriction on length of the filename. But sometimes, you may end-up with files which are having larger than 250 characters and windows will not allow us to delete them.&nbsp;<div>Windows 7 has come up with a tool called robocopy. We can delete long named files with the help of this tool.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Robocopy has an option called mirror copy which will create a mirror of source in destination folder.&nbsp;</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Create an empty folder.&nbsp;</li><li>robocopy empty_folder long_named_directory /s /mir</li><li>Now it will create mirror of empty folder in destination folder leaving bot the folders empty.&nbsp;</li><li>You can happily delete both of them.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>
