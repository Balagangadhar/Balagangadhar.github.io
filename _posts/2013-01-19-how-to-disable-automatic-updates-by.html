Even though liferay service layer is an excellent and efficient tool to work with database and it generates automatic hibernate spring framework, it has some drawback in terms of customization. model-hints.<br /><br />portlet-model-hints.xml and portlet-model-hints-ext.xml entries are work around for customizing database schema. Still if you face any problem and want to continue without liferay service layer database scheme, you can just disable this update with database.<br /><br /><ol><li>Add <b>service-ext.properties</b> in resource folder(If you are not using maven, then locate the path of service.properties and keep extension file in the same path.)</li><li>Enter following entry and restart the server.&nbsp;</li></ol><span class="st">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&nbsp; build.auto.upgrade=false</b></span><b> </b>
