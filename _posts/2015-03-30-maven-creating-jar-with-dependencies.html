While working with the maven, it is a case that all the dependent jars will not be packed into the jar, whereas in case of war, all the dependent jars wil be packed into web/lib folder. If you want to create a simple jar with all its dependency jars then you need to create uber jar.(Uber means Super, extreme or outstanding). Here are the steps to create uber jar using maven.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Step 1 : Create an assembly xml and put it into your resources folder.</li><script src="https://gist.github.com/Balagangadhar/c3bba7216b94999cffad.js"></script><li>Step 2 : Include assembly.xml in your pom in the plugin-configuration node along with the manifest-mainclass.</li><script src="https://gist.github.com/Balagangadhar/c595e44eaa14d9d74680.js"></script><li>Step 3 : Fire <i><b>mvn assembly:assembly</b></i>, it will create simple and uber jar in your target folder.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br /></div>
