ExtJS 4 is a very popular javascript framework to design Rich Internet Applications. It has its own drawing mechanism to draw charts but it doesn't support flowchart mechanism out-of the box. There are some <a href="https://market.sencha.com/extensions/dag-drawer" target="_blank">plugins available</a> to draw flowcharts to some extent.<br />JSPlumb is one of the famous drawing framework to draw shapes/components and connect them. It is build on top of jquery, so we can make use of all the advantages of jquery as well.<br /><br />While I was trying to draw flowcharts in ExtJS, I found JSplumb is one of the suitable frameworks for my requirements, but I couldn't get a complete post/material to integrate these two. Finally I had to buy some time to integrate them and here comes the post.<br /><br />There are wide-variety of javascript libraries available on net(Raphael, Processing.js...) but none of them support diamond(Decision) box as as component. Since JSplumb is built on jquery, we can play with html+CSS and get components as per our wish.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the following fiddle, go to the Result tab, right click on the pane and play-around with it. I have added some jquery events to prove some of the jquery actions. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Balagangadhar/N6nHp/embedded/" width="100%"></iframe> <br /><br />Here is the sample <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Balagangadhar/N6nHp/" target="_blank">fiddle&nbsp; </a>and following is the sample snap-shot of it. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9aBYVbEGNkw/Um0hbpTe_aI/AAAAAAAADrc/9lQeYMSbenE/s1600/ExtJs-JSplumb-flowchart1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9aBYVbEGNkw/Um0hbpTe_aI/AAAAAAAADrc/9lQeYMSbenE/s320/ExtJs-JSplumb-flowchart1.jpg" height="320" width="309" /></a></div><br />Here is the source code : <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ze9EgZv1bUcXZleFYzZUVoa0U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Extjs-Jsplumb-html</a><br /><br />
