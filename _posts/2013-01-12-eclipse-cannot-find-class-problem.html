Recently I have faced <b>Cannot find the class</b>&nbsp;problem in eclipse. I remember my project worked fine last month. Suddenly it is crying to locate some java classes when I compile this project. Still interesting this is that, those classes are there in the mentioned package. Even googling didn't help me.<br /><br />Finally I found a work around.<br /><br />Simple, I copied whole class file into new java class file, deleted the original java class file and renamed the new class name to older java class name.<br /><br />It worked well for me, if you face similar problem try this small tip, it may works.<br /><br />Weird things happen in eclipse some times....
